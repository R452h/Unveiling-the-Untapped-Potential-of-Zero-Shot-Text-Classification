# Unveiling the Untapped Potential of Zero-Shot Text Classification

A project exploring the power of **Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)** for sentiment classification using the **facebook/bart-large-mnli** model from Hugging Face Transformers.  
We compare ZSL with traditional supervised approaches such as **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** across multiple datasets.

## üöÄ Project Overview
Traditional NLP text classification requires **large amounts of labeled data** and frequent retraining for new categories.  
Zero-Shot Text Classification overcomes these limitations by leveraging pre-trained language models to classify text **without explicit training** on each label.

This project:
- Implements **ZSL and traditional models** (Naive Bayes, SVM, RNN).
- Evaluates performance using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
- Visualizes results with **graphs** for a clear comparison.
- Demonstrates **real-life applications** in sentiment analysis and links to **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 & SDG 8).**

## üìä Datasets
We experimented with three datasets:

1. **Amazon Reviews Dataset (10,000 rows)**  
   - Columns: `text`, `label` (positive/negative).  

2. **Twitter Sentiment Dataset (7,920 rows)**  
   - Columns: `id`, `tweet`, `label` (0 = positive, 1 = negative).  

3. **Restaurant Food Reviews Dataset (1,000 rows)**  
   - Columns: `Review`, `Liked` (0 = negative, 1 = positive).

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
- **Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL):**  
  Used `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model from Hugging Face Transformers.  
  Labels are framed as hypotheses (e.g., *‚ÄúThis text is positive‚Äù*) and compared with input text for entailment.

- **Naive Bayes:**  
  Applied Multinomial NB with TF-IDF vectorization.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**  
  Linear kernel, TF-IDF features.

- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**  
  Bidirectional GRU with embedding layers.
